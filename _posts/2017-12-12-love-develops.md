In July 2011, Véro was recruited as a French teacher half-way around the world in Shanghai! John followed, not long after in February 2012, and moved to Hong Kong where he spent the first decade of his life. They made the most out of their short distance apart, meeting every month or so in a new destination in Asia.

In August 2013, Véro finally moved to Hong Kong and they've lived happily ever after!

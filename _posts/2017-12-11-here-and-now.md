They are united by a sense of adventure and a love for traveling. Together they've travelled to over 30 destinations around the world, and ate some really tasty food along the way.

Aside from being an amazing teacher, Véro loves to hike the local mountains and take pictures. John practices Yoga, competes in Crossfit, and runs corporate wellness workshops.

Véro and John both love their life in Hong Kong and are so happy to have you join them on March 31, 2018 as they start the next chapter of their lives together.

    <h2>Come party with us in Tai Hang!</h2>
    <p>Véronique Nobert and John Ho are tying the knot, and you're invited!</p>
    <p>The wedding will take place in Tai Hang, Hong Kong at Tipsy Bar & Restaurant (see the <a href="#location" class="more scrolly">map below</a>) on Saturday, March 31, 2018. The venue is on the first floor with a small outdoor balcony over looking Tung Lo Wan road. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tipsy.restaurant.bar/">restaurant</a> features an open bar and dining area with interior matching the colonial era style of the hotel.</p>
    <p>The neigbhourhood, Tai Hang, itself is a trendy area where local shops and quirky cafés sit side by side. Right next to Victoria Park and with lots of culinary options, it's the prefect place to grab Saturday morning brunch before hand and enjoying the nice weather (historically, temperatures average 20&deg;C, at 77% humidity, and small chance of shower on March 31st in Hong Kong).</p>
    <p>The ceremony is scheduled for 3:00pm, rain or shine. Free flow drinks, canapé, and dessert will be served through out. Guests are welcome to arrive anytime after 2:00pm. We will be indoor mostly (with air conditioning), enjoying good companies, having some nice food and drinks, taking pictures, and grooving to some nice beats. Feel free to wear something smart & casual or whatever you will be comfortable in.</p>
    <p><em>We are planning an after-party as well (likely from 6:00pm to 9:00pm), please check this webpage for updates.</em></p>
